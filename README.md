# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

</header>

### Overview
This is a machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. 
It uses transaction data to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

### Dataset
- The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions from Kaggle 
- Features include transaction amount, time, and anonymized attributes (V1, V2, â€¦)
- The dataset is imbalanced with far fewer fraud cases than legitimate transactions

## Features
- Performed feature engineering
- Trained machine learning models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Provided a confusion matrix for visualisation
