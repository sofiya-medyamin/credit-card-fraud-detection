# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

### Overview
This is a machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. 
It uses transaction data to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

### Dataset
- The dataset used contains anonymized credit card transactions from Kaggle **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**
- Features include transaction amount, time, and anonymized attributes (V1, V2, â€¦ V28)
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer fraudulent transactions than non-fraudulent transactions.

## Features
- Data cleaning & preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Training machine learning models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix for performance visualization
